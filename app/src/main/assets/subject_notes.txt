Java#History#Java is Object Oriented Language. It is a platform independent language.#https://www.javatpoint.com/history-of-java
Java#Classes#Java is an object-oriented programming language.$$$$Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.#https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp
Java#Interfaces#An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.$$$$#https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_interface.asp
Java#Inheritance#Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.$$$$#https://www.javatpoint.com/inheritance-in-java
Java#Polymorphism#Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.$$$$#https://www.javatpoint.com/runtime-polymorphism-in-java
Operating Systems#What is OS?#Operating System is bridge between user and hardware.#https://www.javatpoint.com/os-tutorial
Operating Systems#Process Management#A Program does nothing unless its instructions are executed by a CPU. A program in execution is called a process. In order to accomplish its task, process needs the computer resources.#https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-management-introduction
Operating Systems#Process Synchronization#When two or more process cooperates with each other, their order of execution must be preserved otherwise there can be conflicts in their execution and inappropriate outputs can be produced.#https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-synchronization-introduction
Operating Systems#Deadlock#A Deadlock is a situation where each of the computer process waits for a resource which is being assigned to some another process. In this situation, none of the process gets executed since the resource it needs, is held by some other process which is also waiting for some other resource to be released.#https://www.javatpoint.com/os-deadlocks-introduction
Operating Systems#Memory Management#Computer memory can be defined as a collection of some data represented in the binary format. On the basis of various functions, memory can be classified into various categories.#https://www.javatpoint.com/os-memory-management-introduction
Object Oriented Programming#4 Basic Concept of Object Oriented Programming#Object-oriented programming has four basic concepts: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. Even if these concepts seem incredibly complex, understanding the general framework of how they work will help you understand the basics of a computer program. Here are the four basic theories and what they entail:$$$$Encapsulation$$Abstraction$$Inheritance$$Polymorphism#https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-object-oriented-programming
Object Oriented Programming#Encapsulation#The different objects inside of each program will try to communicate with each other automatically. If a programmer wants to stop objects from interacting with each other, they need to be encapsulated in individual classes. Through the process of encapsulation, classes cannot change or interact with the specific variables and functions of an object.$$$$#https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-object-oriented-programming
Object Oriented Programming#Abstraction#Abstraction is like an extension of encapsulation because it hides certain properties and methods from the outside code to make the interface of the objects simpler. Programmers use abstraction for several beneficial reasons. Overall, abstraction helps isolate the impact of changes made to the code so that if something goes wrong, the change will only affect the variables shown and not the outside code.$$$$#https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-object-oriented-programming
Object Oriented Programming#Inheritance#Using this concept, programmers can extend the functionality of the code's existing classes to eliminate repetitive code. For instance, elements of HTML code that include a text box, select field and checkbox have certain properties in common with specific methods.$$$$#https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-object-oriented-programming
Object Oriented Programming#Polymorphism#This technique meaning "many forms or shapes" allows programmers to render multiple HTML elements depending on the type of object. This concept allows programmers to redefine the way something works by changing how it is done or by changing the parts in which it is done. Terms of polymorphism are called overriding and overloading.$$$$#https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-object-oriented-programming
Database Management Systems#What is Database?#A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.$$#https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-database
Database Management Systems#Relational Model Concept#Relational model can represent as a table with columns and rows. Each row is known as a tuple. Each table of the column has a name or attribute.$$$$#https://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-relational-model-concept
Database Management Systems#Normalization#Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.$$Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate the undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.$$Normalization divides the larger table into the smaller table and links them using relationship.$$The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.#https://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-normalization
Database Management Systems#concurrency control#In a database management system (DBMS), concurrency control manages simultaneous access to a database. It prevents two users from editing the same record at the same time and also serializes transactions for backup and recovery.$$#https://www.guru99.com/dbms-concurrency-control.html
